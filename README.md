# Coke Store Bot
## Helps to search product information, prices, discounts from the inventory

We're creating a project using Google Palm and Langchain technologies to build a system that can talk to a MySQL database. Imagine a store called Coke Store that sells beverages and keeps track of inventory and discounts in this database. The system will understand questions asked in regular language by users and convert them into SQL queries, which it will then run on the MySQL database to fetch answers. For example, a store manager might ask things like:

"How much does a case of Sprite 300ml CAN cost?"
"What promotions are available for Coca Cola 600 ml with discounts greater than 10%?"
The system will be smart enough to understand these questions and fetch accurate information from the database.
